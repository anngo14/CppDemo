Arrays
How Do Arrays Work? 
How do you access the element at an index of an array?
What if you want to delete an element at an index? 
How do types affect arrays? 
How do you swap two elements in an array? 

Write a program to print out all elements in the array.
Write a program to switch every two elements in the array. 
ex. Input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Output [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
    Input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Output [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]
Write a program that replaces all even elements in the array with 0.
ex. Input [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] Output [1, -1, -1, 5, -1, 7]

Vectors
How are they different from arrays? 
Adding and removing elements to a vector? 

Write a program to remove all odd elements in a vector.

if statement
what is an if statement? 
else? 

Write a program to sum all odd and even elements in a vector.
ex. Input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Output odd = 9 even = 12

Loops
for loop
while loop
do while loop

what is an iteration of a loop? 
when does a loop stop executing? 

Nested Loops
keeping track of nested loops
which loop happens first? 
break statement

Variables
what is a variable?
data types?

Functions (Function overload / override)
what is a function? 
how is it different from main?
how is function overloading different from overriding?
when do I need a function?

Return types
what is a return type? 
where is it used? 
what is the point of a return type?

Regular pointers
What is a pointer? 
How do I get the value at a specific pointer?
Why are pointers confusing? 
Why do we need pointers? 

I/O streams
what are i/o streams? 
how are they different from std::cout and std::cin?

structs
what are structs? 
what are they used for? 
what is an object / instance?
